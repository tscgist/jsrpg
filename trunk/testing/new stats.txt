so there's a stat that tracks how effective you are, on a percentage basis

effectiveness
capability
readiness
power
health
condition

and a stat that reflects your resistance to negative changes to that stat

defense
resistance
toughness
resiliance
endurance

so the first describes how effectively you're able to utilize your abilities. the lower this rating, the less effective your abilites will be - the aim of your opponent is to lower this rating until you're effectively powerless.

your resistance to your opponent's efforts is the second stat - if you have 100 points of effectiveness, and 50 points of resistance, that's the equivalent of 10 points of effectiveness and 500 points of resistance? I guess? So basically more HP and less defense, or less HP and more defense.
